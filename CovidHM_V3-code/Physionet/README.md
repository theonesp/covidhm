# COVID Data for Shared Learning (CDSL) Code
'COVID Data for Shared Learning', available in Physionet's repository, is an updated, de-identified version of the original 'COVID Data Saves Lives' published on the HM Hospitales website. The key changes include:
 - Anonymization procedures: de-identification of patient identifiers and date shifting.
 - DICOM to JPG conversion for ease of storage, processing and usability. 
 - Translation to English.
 - Minor data cleaning. 

 CDSL database 1.0.0 comprises the following tabular data: patient, diagnosis_er, diagnosis_hosp, vital_signs, medication and lab from a total of 4,479 hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, along with 1,444,764 radiology images and relevant metadata, specifically 4,608 radiographs and 1,440,156 CT scans.
